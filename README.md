# uncited-statement-detection
A machine-learning-based model to automatically score statements needing inline citations

To guarantee reliability, Wikipedia's Verifiability policy requires inline citations for any material challenged or likely to be challenged, and for all quotations, anywhere in the article space. While already around 300K statements have been identified as unsourced, we might be missing many more!
This projects aims to the community discover potentially unsourced statements, i.e. statements that need an inline citation to a reliable source, using a machine assisted framework.
