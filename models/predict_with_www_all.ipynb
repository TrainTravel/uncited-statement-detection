He further added that the Victorian was \"the very essence of belligerence...His whole attitude suggests defiance and when he hits the ball it is the music of a sledgehammer.\" Former Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly, while agreeing that Loxton was always energetic, regarded his bowling as being too dull and predictable to have any major impact at the highest level, and thought that the Victorian all-rounder's career would have been best served by saving his energy purely for batting.\n",

Many commentators condemned the alteration of the field as unsporting, and the angry spectators became extremely volatile. Jardine, although writing that Woodfull could have retired hurt if he was unfit, later expressed his regret at making the field change at that moment. The fury of the crowd was such that a riot may have occurred had another incident taken place and several writers suggested that the anger of the spectators was the culmination of feelings built up over the two months that bodyline had developed.\n",

      "En 1920, il est employé par l'Ordnance Survey. À ce poste, il fait le tour de la Grande-Bretagne pour localiser les sites archéologiques dans le paysage, ce qui lui permet d'identifier plusieurs sites inconnus auparavant. De plus en plus intéressé par l'archéologie aérienne, il obtient des photographies aériennes produites par la Royal Air Force, et identifie l'étendue de l'Avenue de Stonehenge, qu'il fouille en 1923. Avec l'archéologue Alexander Keiller, il mène une étude aérienne sur de nombreux comtés du sud de l'Angleterre et contribue à la collecte des fonds nécessaires pour acquérir les terres autour de Stonehenge et les présenter au National Trust dans le but d'éviter qu'elles ne soient ultérieurement endommagées par un développement agricole ou urbain. En 1927, il crée la revue scientifique Antiquity, qui recueille des contributions de nombreux archéologues parmi les plus éminents de Grande-Bretagne et, en 1939, il accède à la présidence de The Prehistoric Society. Internationaliste et socialiste, il est influencé par le marxisme et devient un temps sympathisant soviétique. Pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, il travaille avec les Archives historiques de l'Angleterre, il est chargé d'un projet de documentation photographique à Southampton. Après sa retraite en 1946, il se concentre à nouveau sur l'archéologie soudanaise et écrit plusieurs livres avant sa mort.\n",

      "La mort est une interruption temporaire de la vie et non une fin définitive. Comme les dieux, les humains survivent grâce à leurs principes immatériels que sont l'âme-Ba, la vitalité-Ka et l'esprit-Akh. Dès l'Ancien Empire, deux cycles de croyances religieuses caractérisent la conception de la vie éternelle. D'un côté, le mythe d'Osiris traite tous les aspects de la préservation du cadavre par les rites de la momification. De l'autre, le mythe solaire concerne le voyage du défunt auprès de Rê à bord de la barque solaire. Au Nouvel Empire, ces deux mythes forment une unité de croyance, le dieu solaire voyageant à travers les contrées souterraines et osiriennes. Certains recueils funéraires sont des cartes de ce monde mystérieux. Ils guident les défunts sur des chemins ponctués de nombreux dangers. D'après le Livre de l'Amdouat et le Livre des Portes, l'au-delà est une zone souterraine constituée de douze régions successives. Chaque région correspond à une heure de la nuit et chacune d'elles est séparée de la suivante par un portail surveillé par des dieux-gardiens. Le destin du défunt est déterminé par l'épreuve du jugement de l'âme. Acquitté, il entre dans le royaume d'Osiris. À l'image du pays égyptien, l'au-delà est un désert traversé par un fleuve qui inonde champs et marais. Dans le Champ des Offrandes, le défunt retrouve les mêmes activités que de son vivant. Il y travaille ses champs et profite de bons moments de repos et de joie. Tout au contraire, pour les damnés sont réservés des salles de torture, des fosses ardentes et des lacs pestilentiels.\n",

Their first attempt to replace him failed when Brownlee, their intended replacement, refused to have anything to do with the plan, but a second attempt, in 1925, was successful when Brownlee agreed to take office if Greenfield personally requested that he do so. Greenfield had not wanted the job in the first place, and agreed to resign in Brownlee's favour.\n",

He further showed that Barnes had not agitated when reminded of the policy against players meeting with family members on tour. However, Johnson believed that the cumulative effect of the misdeeds \"warranted omission from the team\" and he saw no problem in the fact that his verbal advice to the board recommending Barnes' exclusion was at odds with the written report on the 1948 tour. Under pressure from Shand, Johnson admitted that \"I don't always write what I think\". According to Haigh, \"Shand effortlessly twisted him [Johnson] inside out\".\n",

      "Kościuszko was born in February 1746, in a manor house on the Mereczowszczyzna estate in Nowogródek Voivodeship, Grand Duchy of Lithuania, a part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. His exact birthdate is unknown. At age 20, he graduated from the Corps of Cadets in Warsaw, Poland, but after the outbreak of a civil war involving the Bar Confederation in 1768, Kościuszko moved to France in 1769 to pursue further studies. He returned to Poland in 1774, two years after its First Partition, and took a position as tutor in Józef Sylwester Sosnowski's household. After Kościuszko attempted to elope with his employer's daughter and was severely beaten by the father's retainers, he returned to France. In 1776, Kościuszko moved to North America, where he took part in the American Revolutionary War as a colonel in the Continental Army. An accomplished military architect, he designed and oversaw the construction of state-of-the-art fortifications, including those at West Point, New York. In 1783, in recognition of his services, the Continental Congress promoted him to brigadier general.\n",

      "Although the population of native Catholics expanded greatly in the years following his consecration, Soegijapranata was soon faced with numerous trials. The Empire of Japan invaded the Indies beginning in early 1942, and during the ensuing occupation numerous churches were seized and clergymen were arrested or killed. Soegijapranata was able to resist several of these seizures, and spent the rest of the occupation serving the Catholics in his vicariate. After President Sukarno proclaimed the country's independence in August 1945, Semarang was overcome with unrest. Soegijapranata helped broker a ceasefire after a five-day battle between Japanese and Indonesian troops and called for the central government to send someone to deal with the unrest and food shortages in the city. However, these problems continued to grow, and in 1947 Soegijapranata moved his seat to Yogyakarta. For the remainder of the national revolution Soegijapranata worked to promote international recognition of Indonesia's independence. Soon after the Dutch, who had returned in late 1945, recognised the country's independence, Soegijapranata returned to Semarang. During the post-revolution years he wrote extensively against communism and expanded the church; he also served as a mediator between several political factions. He was made an archbishop on 3January 1961, when Semarang was elevated to an ecclesiastical province. At the time he was in Europe, participating in the first session of the Second Vatican Council. Soegijapranata died in 1963, in Steyl, the Netherlands. His body was flown back to Indonesia, where he was made a national hero and interred at Giri Tunggal Heroes' Cemetery in Semarang.\n",

      "In the decade following World War II, Eaton led No.81 Wing in Japan, and No.78 Wing in Malta. He commanded RAAF Base Williamtown from 1957 to 1959, after which he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. As Director-General of Operational Requirements in 1965, Eaton argued for increased RAAF co-operation with the Australian Army in light of growing involvement in the Vietnam War. He was promoted to air vice marshal the next year, and became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff. Posted to Singapore as Air Officer Commanding (AOC) No.224 Group RAF in 1967, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath for his work as chief of staff at Headquarters RAF Far East Air Force in 1969. He then served as Air Member for Personnel, before being selected as AOC Operational Command in 1973. Eaton retired from the RAAF in December that year, and became an executive for Rolls-Royce in Canberra. He died in 1992 at the age of 75.\n",

      "Treloar's career was focussed on the Australian military and its history. Prior to World War I he worked as a clerk in the Department of Defence and, after volunteering for the AIF in 1914, formed part of the Australian Army officer Brudenell White's staff for most of the war's first years. He was appointed commander of the Australian War Records Section (AWRS) in 1917. In this position, he improved the AIF's records and collected a large number of artefacts for later display in Australia. Treloar was appointed the director of what eventually became the AWM in 1920, and was a key figure in establishing the Memorial and raising funds for its permanent building in Canberra. He left the AWM at the outbreak of World War II to lead the Australian Government's Department of Information, but was effectively sidelined for much of 1940. In early 1941 he was appointed to command the Australian military's Military History and Information Section with similar responsibilities to those he had held during World War I. He attempted to intervene in the management of the AWM during his absence, however, to the increasing frustration of its acting director. Treloar worked intensely in all his roles and suffered periods of ill-health as a result. Following the war, he returned to the Memorial in 1946 but his performance deteriorated over time, possibly due to exhaustion. He died in January 1952.\n",
